# AlienForceProject
A remake of the 1990 game for Windows 3.

Currently the game board is set up, you can control the player, your shots destroy enemies, and colliding with enemies destroys you. I implemented one version of pathfinding that I was having trouble with and didn't like, so I'm working on a different approach right now.
